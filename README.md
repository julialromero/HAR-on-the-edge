# HAR-on-the-edge
I am working on a lightweight deep learning model for human activity recognition (HAR) for local processing on the edge. I do a short exploration of a HAR dataset, then manually preprocess and segment the data. I create a simple network and binarize it (1-bit quantization) so that the layer parameters and inputs to the layers are binary values. 
This model is CPU friendly!

Still working on it...but the end goal is to deploy it. I plan to create an app for my smartwatch or mobile phone to run the model and display the predicted activity in real-time.
